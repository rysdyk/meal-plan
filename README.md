# Goals

Version 1 of this app is a MVP-style meal planning app. It is NOT a recipe sharing app (maybe later...). Users will upload there personal favorite recipes and generate grocery lists.

The goals of this app include helping people:

  1. Save Time (easily choose recipes and generate grocery lists)
  2. Save Money (buy only what you need)
  3. Help Environment (waste less food)
  4. Have More Fun (cooking is fun)
  5. Be Healthier (cooking at home is healthy)

Technical goals of this app is to work as both a stand-alone rails app, as well as a API (Angular front-end coming later?)

# Notes

This is a meal planning app using Rails 5 and PostgreSQL.
